# Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL)

In the chapter of propositional logic we have seen the combinatorial explosion problem that results from the need to include in the reasoning / inference step all possible states and actions combinations over time (the KB was growing substantially over time). 

To avoid such explosion, with obvious benefits to the planning efficiency, we 

1. Introduce a factored representation language called Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) that allows for compressive expressiveness of the planning domain (general application space such as logistics) and problem (the specific logistics task we face). 

2. Solve the planning problem by using *domain-independent* solvers that are able to reason over the PDDL expressed domain and problem. The domain independence is probably not the most efficient way to solve a planning problem but it is the most general and flexible way to do so and the associated tradeoff is worth making.

As show in the figure below, a domain-independent solver or planner takes two inputs: 1) the domain model written in a planning language and in the so called domain file and 2) a problem definition that describes the initial state $i$ and the desired goal state $g$ using the domain modelâ€™s terminology; and produces as output a plan, that is, a sequence of actions
that takes the agent from the initial state to the goal state.

## PDDL Language Constructs

### PDDL Domain File

PDDL expresses the four things we need to plan a sequence of actions. The set of all predicates and action schemas are defined in the **domain** file ($\mathtt{domain.pddl}$) as shown next. 

| Domain Syntax           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Types**               | A description of the possible _types_ of objects in the world. A type can inherit from another type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Constants**           | The set of _constants_, which are objects which appear in all problem instances of this domain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Predicates**          | A predicate is the part of a sentence or clause containing a verb and stating something about the subject. Each predicate is described by a name and a signature, consisting of an ordered list of types. Properties of the objects (contained in the problem specification) we are interested in. Each property evaluates to TRUE or FALSE. The domain also describes a set of derived predicates, which are predicates associated with a logical expression. The value of each derived predicate is computed automatically by evaluating the logical expression associated with it. |
| **Actions / Operators** | Actions are described by action schemas that effectively define the functions needed to do problem-solving search. The schema consist of the _name_, the signature or the list of all the boolean _variables_ that are _ground_ and functionless, a _precondition_ and _effect_. The signature is now an ordered list of named parameters, each with a type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|                         | The **precondition** is a logical formula, whose basic building blocks are the above mentioned predicates, combined using the standard first-order logic logical connectives. The predicates can only be parametrized by the operator parameters, the domain constraints, or, if they appear within the scope of a forall or exists statement, by the variable introduced by the quantifier.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|                         | The **effect** is similar, except that it described a partial assignment, rather than a formula, and thus can not contain any disjunctions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
In PDDL a state is a conjunction of ground boolean predicates which means that if the predicate has any arguments they are constants (grounded) without any variables. For example,  $$\mathtt{On(Box_1, Table_2) \land On(Box_2, Table_2)}$$  is a state expression. $\mathtt{Box_1}$ is distinct than $\mathtt{Box_2}$. All fluents that are not specified are assumed to be FALSE - the so-called *closed world* assumption.

Note that the specification via _action schemas_ rather than via an enumeration of all possible actions for all possible states is compressive via the usage of variables. 

For the famous Blocksworld domain shown below where a robotic arm must reason to stack blocks according what the goal is, we list the corresponding domain PDDL specification.  

![blocks-world](images/blocks-world.png)
*Blocks planning problem*

In natural language, the rules are:

* Blocks are picked up and put down by the arm

* Blocks can be picked up only if they are clear, i.e.,
without any block on top

* The arm can pick up a block only if the arm is empty, i.e.,
if it is not holding another block, i.e., the arm can be pick
up only one block at a time

* The arm can put down blocks on blocks or on the table 

Noteworthy is that these rules can be automatically translated into PDDL via [ad-hoc](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:1727bc3f-c0ca-4439-9590-914339678723) or via [foundational Large Language Models (LLMs)](https://icaps23.icaps-conference.org/demos/papers/6374_paper.pdf).

In PDDL these rules are expressed as: 

```pddl


;; This is the 4-action blocks world domain which does 
not refer to a table object and distinguishes actions for 
moving blocks to-from blocks and moving blocks to-from table

(define (domain blocksworld)

special ontable predicate

		)
)

)
```


The objects, the initial state and the goal specifications are defined in the **problem** file ($\mathtt{problem.pddl}$) as shown next.

| Problem Syntax    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Initial State** | Each state is represented as conjunction of ground boolean variables. For example,  $$\mathtt{On(Box_1, Table_2) \land On(Box_2, Table_2)}$$  is a state expression. $\mathtt{Box_1}$ is distinct than $\mathtt{Box_2}$. All fluents that are not specified are assumed to be FALSE. |
| **Goal**          | All things we want to be TRUE. The goal is like a precondition - a conjunction of literals that may contain variables.                                                                                                                                                               |



```pddl

(define (problem BLOCKS-11-0)

to invoke [this planning server](http://editor.planning.domains/) and ensure you understand the ropes of using PDDL planners. The blocks word problem is a classic problem employed in the International Planning Competition (IPC) 2000. For non-trivial examples in robotics see [Plansys2](https://github.com/PlanSys2/ros2_planning_system) - any AI engineer must know and understand the ROS2 platform.

## PDDL Solvers (Planners)

Now we need to look how the planners solve the PDDL expressed problems. As it turns out many use the Forward (state-space) Search algorithms where despite the factored representation assumed here, we can treat states and actions as atomic and use forward search algorithms with heuristics such as A*. 

The [Fast Downward](http://www.fast-downward.org/) planner is a state-of-the-art planner that uses the [FF heuristic](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/ICAPS/2003/ICAPS03-019.pdf) and the [LAMA heuristic](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICAPS/ICAPS10/paper/view/1441) to solve PDDL problems. The VSCode PDDL extension [allows for visualizing the search tree](https://youtu.be/_NOVa4i7Us8?list=PL1Q0jeuU6XppS_r2Sa9fzVanpbXKqLsYS&t=384) so make sure you understand how the search tree is constructed and how the search algorithm works. 

PDDL as a representational language is [evolving](https://planning.wiki/ref) and new solvers are regularly appearing to allow us to relax the contraints such as determinism, full observability, etc. and apply planning to more realistic problems.
