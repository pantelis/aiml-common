# Relational Planning


In this project a premise is made and you are called to test its validity or not - to the best of our knowledge this premise is new and has not be shown already.

_Can automated planning efficiency be improved by establishing and considering relations between entities of the scene  ?_  

Automated planning is covered [here](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/newchap11.pdf) and the answer to such question goes beyond the scope of a class project. Having said that, the aim here is to create some foundational background for you to be able to provide an answer even after the class deadline - as its attempted to be done [in this paper](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Learning-value-functions-with-relational-state-for-Kim-Shimanuki/7094b1f86944517d0b03cf466be63ddf5780c59d)
