Using the [linear regression example from the class notes](https://pantelis.github.io/artificial-intelligence/aiml-common/lectures/regression/linear-regression/linear_regression.html), develop from scratch the baseline SGD algorithm. Feel free nto generate more examples than shown in . \n",

Implement from scratch the following enhancements and compare the convergence speed of each algorithm to the baseline SGD algorithm\n",
